Project has not been updated since 2000.
I would like to use the code.
I see some places where I can improve the efficiency for batch operations.

* Move examples to test folders.

* Add jspecify to stop null checking.

* Shingle-based: Some subclasses just use the keys of the profile, so create string array of keys

* Jaccard: Allow cached profiles

* Vector and matrix processing
